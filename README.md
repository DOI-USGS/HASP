The [Hydrologic Analysis Package
(HASP)](https://code.usgs.gov/water/stats/hasp) can retrieve groundwater
level and groundwater quality data, aggregate these data, plot them, and
generate basic statistics. One of the benefits of HASP is its ability to
aggregate two time-series of data into one record and generate
statistics and graphics on that record. By merging two data sets
together, users can view and manipulate a much longer record of data.
Users can download the aggregated record and see basic statistics that
have been calculated with these data. HASP also allows users to plot
groundwater level trends in major aquifers as well. The explore_aquifers
function allows users to pull data from wells classified in Principal
Aquifers and synthesize water-level data to better understand trends.

## Installation of HASP

You can install the `HASP` package using the `remotes` package.

To install the remotes package, copy the following line into R or the
“Console” window in RStudio:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

To install the `HASP` package:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab("water/stats/hasp",
                        host = "code.usgs.gov",
                        build_opts = c("--no-resave-data",
                                       "--no-manual"),
                        build_vignettes = TRUE, 
                        dependencies = TRUE)
```

During this installation, you may be prompted to update or install some
packages. Press 3 to skip the updates, but don’t forget to update all of
your packages later.

## Sample workflow

### Get groundwater data:

``` r
library(HASP)
library(dataRetrieval)
site <- "263819081585801"

#Field GWL data:
gwl_data <- dataRetrieval::readNWISgwl(site)

# Daily data:
parameterCd <- "62610"
statCd <- "00001"
dv <- dataRetrieval::readNWISdv(site,
                                parameterCd,
                                statCd = statCd)
```

### Plot data:

``` r

y_axis_label <- readNWISpCode(parameterCd)$parameter_nm
title <- readNWISsite(site)$station_nm

monthly_frequency_plot(dv,
                       gwl_data,
                       parameter_cd = parameterCd,
                       plot_title = title,
                       y_axis_label = y_axis_label)
```

![](man/figures/README-graphs-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r

weekly_frequency_plot(dv, 
                      gwl_data,
                      parameter_cd = parameterCd, 
                      stat_cd = statCd,
                      plot_title = title,
                      y_axis_label = y_axis_label)
```

![](man/figures/README-graphs-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r

daily_gwl_plot(dv, 
               gwl_data,
               parameter_cd = parameterCd,
               plot_title = title,
               stat_cd = statCd,
               y_axis_label = y_axis_label)
```

![](man/figures/README-graphs-3.png)<!-- -->

``` r

gwl_plot_all(gw_level_dv = dv, 
             gwl_data = gwl_data, 
             parameter_cd = parameterCd,
             plot_title = title, 
             add_trend = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-graphs-4.png)<!-- -->

## Create Groundwater Report:

``` r
create_groundwater_report(siteID = site,
                          report_name = "L_2701",
                          report_folder = "reports",
                          output_type = "html")
```

Running this function will create an Rmarkdown file (Rmd). In RStudio,
clicking the button “Knit” at the top of the file will render the Rmd
file as either an HTML or Word document.

## Water-quality plots

HASP also includes a few water-quality plot options.

``` r
# Water Quality data:

qw_data <- readWQPqw(paste0("USGS-", site),
                     c("Chloride",
                       "Specific conductance"))

qw_plot(qw_data, CharacteristicName = "Chloride",
        plot_title = title)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r

Sc_Cl_plot(qw_data, plot_title = title)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-3-2.png)<!-- -->

### Composite workflows:

More information on the composite aquifer workflow can be found
`vignette("Priniciple_Aquifers", package = "HASP")`.

``` r

#included sample data:

aquifer_data <- aquifer_data
num_years <- 30

plot_composite_data(aquifer_data, num_years)
```

![](man/figures/README-example-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r

plot_normalized_data(aquifer_data, num_years)
```

![](man/figures/README-example-2.png)<!-- -->

## Installation of R and RStudio

To use the HASP package, you will need to have R and RStudio installed
on your computer. This installation will only need to be done once for
each computer. This link has instructions for installing R and RStudio:

## Running the apps

`HASP` includes two interactive applications as a way to explore the
functionality of this package. One has functions for exploring data from
a single site, and the other has functions for exploring data from an
aquifer.

For more information see `vignette("shinyApp", package = "HASP")`.

To run the single site application, use the following code:

``` r
HASP::explore_site()
```

To run the aquifer application use the following code:

``` r
HASP::explore_aquifers()
```

## Sample workflow

### Single site workflows:
```{r singleSiteShow, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(HASP)
library(dataRetrieval)
site <- "263819081585801"

#Field GWL data:
gwl_data <- dataRetrieval::readNWISgwl(site)

# Daily data:
parameterCd <- "62610"
statCd <- "00001"
dv <- dataRetrieval::readNWISdv(site,
                                parameterCd,
                                statCd = statCd)

# Water Quality data:
parameterCd <- c("00095","90095","00940","99220")
qw_data <- dataRetrieval::readWQPqw(paste0("USGS-", site),
                                    parameterCd)


```


```{r graphs, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

y_axis_label <- dataRetrieval::readNWISpCode("62610")$parameter_nm

monthly_frequency_plot(dv,
                       parameter_cd = "62610",
                       plot_title = "L2701_example_data",
                       y_axis_label = y_axis_label)

gwl_plot_all(gw_level_dv = dv, 
             gwl_data = gwl_data, 
             parameter_cd = "62610",
             plot_title = "L2701_example_data", 
             add_trend = TRUE, flip_y = FALSE)

Sc_Cl_plot(qw_data, "L2701_example_data")
trend_plot(qw_data, plot_title = "L2701_example_data")
```

### Composite workflows:
```{r example}

#included sample data:

aquifer_data <- aquifer_data
num_years <- 30

plot_composite_data(aquifer_data, num_years)

plot_normalized_data(aquifer_data, num_years)
```

## Installation of R and RStudio

To use the HASP package, you will need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer. This installation will only need to be done once for each computer. This link has instructions for installing R and RStudio:  
  
[R and RStudio Installation Instructions](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training-curriculum/installr/)  

Useful links:

* [Download R Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
* [Download R Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
* [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## Installation of HASP

You can install the `HASP` package using the `remotes` package.

To install the remotes package, copy the following line into R or the "Console" window in RStudio:

```{r installRemotes, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
```

To install the `HASP` package:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_gitlab("water/stats/hasp",
                        host = "code.usgs.gov",
                        build_opts = c("--no-resave-data",
                                       "--no-manual"),
                        build_vignettes = TRUE, 
                        dependencies = TRUE)
```

During this installation, you may be prompted to update or install some packages. Press 3 to skip the updates, but don't forget to update all of your packages later.

## Running the apps

`HASP` includes two interactive applications as a way to explore the functionality of this package. One has functions for exploring data from a single site, and the other has functions for exploring data from an aquifer.  
  
To run the single site application, use the following code:  

```{r runSingleSiteApp, eval = FALSE}
HASP::explore_site()
```

To run the aquifer application use the following code:

```{r runAquiferApp, eval = FALSE}
HASP::explore_aquifers()
```
